<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born in a small town in Indiana, population 60, on a good day. 
  I never really had huge dreams of doing anything important other than risking it all for male attention or jumping into a body of water I shouldn't.
  Drinking quickly became my favorite past time and I moved from Indiana to Arizona and continued to move around, venturing from Florida to where I eventually wound up which is Seattle, Washington.
  Drink still at the forefront of my life and battling every childhood trauma you could imagine I had to make some decisions about how I want to live my life.
  I could count my last breath on the floor of some tacky nightclub or bar with only $5 in my bank account to show for my 60 hour work weeks or I could try to live a life I was proud of and deserved.</p>

<p>I think in order to make more sense of things I should back up a bit. My mother raised 3 girls, I, of course, fell right in the middle.
  Insert every middle child stereotype here. 
  I wish I could say it just ended with the bitterness of being forgotten by my own family but unfortunately the trauma during my teenage years left more scars than just your average angst.
  Here I am fighting however, with the help of an amazing care team of psychiatrist, therapist and more medication than a human would think they need I am slowly working my way into a life that is healthy and peaceful.
  Cue theatrical postive music here.
</p>

<p>My road through drug and alcohol abuse (5 years sober now!) and the terrifying mental health battles I have fought through only give me more motivation each day to build a life that I can wake up and be happy with. 
  In doing so I have decided to take on the new world (to me) of learning to write/understand code in the hopes that someday I can create something amazing with the ever changing new technology.
